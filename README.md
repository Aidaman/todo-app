## Personal 

While it is not that important to the project, I still want to assert my own point on how the development should be:
    - Perfectionism is obsolete. It makes things more complicated than needed 🙅
    - To be productive one should be disciplined and dedicated 💁
    - There is no need to force one to do anything. Otherwise, nothing will be done right 🤦
    - Explicit is better than implicit 💁
    - Well-organised and intuitive is better than spontaneous and random 💁
    - Any science at some point may seem magic 🔮
    - Magic reevaluates to science once studied enough 👨🏻‍🔬
    - Quantity of content is significant, but the quality is more important

I am open to conversation on that topic at any time with anybody
